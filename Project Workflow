### E-commerce Product Categorization Project Workflow

This section provides a detailed description of the workflow followed to develop the e-commerce product categorization model.

#### 1. Problem Understanding and Dataset Overview

- **Objective**: Categorize e-commerce products into their respective categories based on product descriptions and other numerical features.
- **Datasets**:
  - **Training Dataset**: 15,000 records with 15 features including the target variable `product_category_tree`.
  - **Test Dataset**: ~2,500 records with 14 features (excluding the target).

#### 2. Data Loading and Initial Exploration

- Load data into pandas DataFrames.
- Perform initial exploration to understand data structure and check for missing values.

#### 3. Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: Fill missing values in the `description` column.
- **Feature Extraction**:
  - **Text Features**: Transform product descriptions using TF-IDF vectorization.
  - **Numerical Features**: Scale numerical features for uniformity.

#### 4. Feature Combination

- Combine transformed text features and scaled numerical features into a single feature matrix.

#### 5. Model Training

- **Train-Test Split**: Split the combined feature matrix and target variable into training and validation sets.
- **Model Selection**: Select LightGBM as the primary model for classification.
- **Model Training**: Train the LightGBM model on the training set.

#### 6. Model Evaluation

- **Validation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set using accuracy and classification report.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Generate and visualize confusion matrices to understand model performance.

#### 7. Hyperparameter Tuning

- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters and improve performance.

#### 8. Test Data Prediction

- Process the test data using the same preprocessing steps applied to the training data.
- Use the trained model to predict product categories for the test data.
- Save the predictions to a CSV file for submission.

#### 9. Documentation and Reporting

- **Code Documentation**: Document each code block, describing the purpose and rationale behind the decisions.
- **Results Analysis**: Compare model performance on both training and test datasets.
- **Comprehensive Report**: Prepare a detailed report and presentation covering the entire project workflow, including lessons learned.
- **Submission**: Submit the Jupyter Notebook, test data output, presentation, video walkthrough, and GitHub link with all deliverables. Optionally, create a Streamlit app for showcasing the model.

This workflow ensures a systematic approach to developing an accurate and efficient e-commerce product categorization model, leveraging both text and numerical features for robust performance.
